usability workflow:

vscode:
	open/close explore bar
	switch focus between focus bar and main panel
	open/close terminal
	switch focus between terminal and main panel
	search thing at top?

control youtube videos w keyboard

1. launch programs using only keyboard
check
	windows key + search
	windows key + taskbar number
	alt+space(launchy)

navigate between windows
nav between documents
	check, but these could be improved possibly?
		(ctrl + up/down)
		
open/close documents
(accessing 'alt' menu at top when in input mode is often problemsome)
	solution(new key combo for arrow keys?)
	solution(don't use input mode to access that menu)

new key combo to switch to command mode without pressing esc
	solution(control key ?)
	solution(holding either esc or control key instead of tapping already works)

switch between documents more easily (ctrl+tab for vscode and firefox)

running/testing docuents more easily 
	(vscode plugin?)
	(something with command prompt?)

switch panes in explorer more easily
right-click menu in explorer

improve mouse mode usabiility

in explorer, ctrl+n to open a new explorer windows
ctrl+shift+n to create new folder

how to position explorer windows quickly using the keyboard?

launchy

ctrl+alt+tab nav between open windows with arrow keys

remap win+L?
	(win+shift+l?)

minimize current window
	(win+m and win+d minimize all windows)

adjust vim keys to be able to be used as arrow keys while alt is being pressed
	(this will help with both the alt menu and with ctrl+tab app switching)

adjust vim keys to support ctrl+arrow so that moving through text can be faster

adjust vim keys to support:
	win+up(maximize window)
	win+down(minimize current screen)
	win+left/right (snap to sides)
	
------------------------------------
ctrl + left/right (move cursor to next/prev word)
ctrl+shift+esc (open task manager)
alt+enter (open properties for selected item in explorer)
win+period (enter rearrange mode)
	while holding win:
		left/right(move border)
		up(maximize window)
		down(close window)

consider registry edit to add a link to my custom cmd prompt to the right-click menu

vsCode keyboard shortcuts:
	shift+alt+right/left to expand/shrink selection between tags in html
	alt+up/down (moves current line up/down)
	alt+shift+up/down (copy current line up/down)
	ctrl+D (add next occurance to selection to change multiple lines at once)
	ctr+alt+shift+down (when using ctrl+d, this adds only the occurances immediately below the selected)
		collapse/expand all
	ctrl+shift+[/] (collapse/expand current item)
	Ctrl+b (toggle explorer panel)
	ctrl+up/down to navigate document tabs (easier than ctrl+tab)
	
	the following come from https://blog.logrocket.com/learn-these-keyboard-shortcuts-to-become-a-vs-code-ninja/
	
	ctrl+\ (split current tab)
	ctrl+1/2/3... (jump to 1st, 2nd, 3rd,... split panel)
	ctrl+0 (open explorer panel)
	alt+left/right (navigate forward/backward in file history[instead of ctrl+tab])
	ctrl+t(find code)
	ctrl+g(go to line)
	ctrl+u(jump back)
	f12 (jump to definition)
	alt+f12 (peek at implementation)
	shift+f12(peek at references)
	f2 (change name of symbol in entire document)
	f8 (look at error)
	set shortcut to 'show hover' command
	alt+shift+left/right (shrink/expand selection based on scope)
	ctrl+` (open terminal)
	ctrl+shift+p (open command pallette)
	
	
better line select
